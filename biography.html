    <h1>Olga Lockenkopf</h1>

    <p>Olga Lockenkopf, a Swiss composer and interdisciplinary artist, was born in 1979 in Istanbul. She spent her childhood there before moving to Zurich in her early teens, where she was shaped by her parents—both prominent linguists and archaeologists specializing in antiquity and Arabic studies. Her older brother is now a well-known journalist based in Japan.</p>

    <p>Early on, Olga displayed exceptional musical talent, particularly on the piano and harmonica, and gained recognition as a prodigy. At age eleven, she composed her first work: a setting of Shakespeare’s Sonnet No. 7.</p>

    <p>Her artistic development was deeply influenced by the Viennese School and the Turkish compositional tradition of the 1960s and ’70s. She also draws inspiration from the folk music of Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Central Asia, and Russia, with visible traces of the Soviet-Russian school in her work.</p>

    <p>Olga now lives and works independently in Vienna. Her music is often shaped by a deep nostalgia for Saint Petersburg—her favorite city, which provides the emotional backdrop for many of her compositions.</p>

    <p>Beyond composing, Olga is also a visual artist specializing in ceramic painting. She often finds inspiration by the sea, where she swims—an activity for which she has received multiple awards. Greece serves as a creative retreat, though she occasionally longs for her birthplace, Turkey.</p>

    <p>In contrast to current trends of constant visibility, Olga chooses a more withdrawn artistic life. She believes that serious artistic depth can only arise through quiet dedication, honest dialogue with the world and oneself, and close exchange with trusted friends.</p>
