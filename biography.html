    <h1>Olga Lockenkopf</h1>

    <p>Olga Lockenkopf, a Swiss composer and versatile artist, was born in 1979 in Istanbul. She spent her childhood there before moving to Zurich in her early teens, where she was strongly influenced by her parents—leading linguists and archaeologists specializing in antiquity and Arabic studies. Her older brother is now a renowned journalist and foreign correspondent based in Japan.</p>

    <p>From an early age, Olga demonstrated exceptional musical talent, especially on the piano and harmonica, earning early recognition as a prodigy. At the age of eleven, she composed her first work: a musical setting of Shakespeare's Sonnet No. 7.</p>

    <p>Her artistic development was shaped by the Viennese School and the Turkish compositional tradition of the 1960s and ’70s. She is also inspired by the folk music of Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Central Asia, and Russia. The influence of the Soviet-Russian compositional school is also perceptible in her work.</p>

    <p>Today, Olga lives and works independently in Vienna. Her creative work is often marked by a deep nostalgia for Saint Petersburg—her favorite city, whose atmosphere plays a central role in many of her works.</p>

    <p>In addition to her musical career, Olga is also an accomplished visual artist, mainly devoted to painting on ceramics. She enjoys spending her free time by the sea, where she swims—having received multiple awards—and gathers new inspiration for her artistic work. Greece offers her an ideal retreat, though she occasionally longs for her birthplace, Turkey.</p>

    <p>In contrast to today’s trend of "the more public, the better," Olga prefers to devote herself to artistic work in seclusion. Her way of life is based on the conviction that true depth in music and art can only arise through intimate dedication, private engagement with the world and oneself, and heartfelt exchange with close friends.</p>
